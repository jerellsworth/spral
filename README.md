# Stupid Python RetroArch Launcher

Let me pick roms with a file browser ffs.

Cross-platform(?) single-file Python script that lets you easily pick RetroArch content from a native file browser. Makes some effort to remember which core you have previously used to run files in a given directory with a given file extension.

## Install on Macos
brew install python3
brew install python-tk
